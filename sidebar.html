**Guidelines:**
     
     
- When you upvote a comment, you're not just expressing approval, you're saying that this is the best comment in the thread and everyone should see its first. Voting is power, and like Batman's uncle said: "With great power comes a lot of responsibility". [Use it wisely](http://www.reddit.com/r/shittyaskscience/comments/pd56u/if_we_might_be_serious_for_a_moment_i_ask_you/)
     
- cross-posts from /r/askscience are encouraged
     
- [No more mentioning brand-name soft drinks](http://i.imgur.com/wPvEd.png). If you really have to bring up the fizzy goodness (and do you? *really*?) Then "cola" or "orange drank" will do fine
     
     
- Don't be a dick. If your submission title is offensive then you're doing it wrong
     
     
- The word "poop" is banned
